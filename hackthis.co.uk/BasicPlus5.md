In Basic+ Level 6 we have to find 3 things:

* ip address of the server hosting the website
* Who is hosting the website
* X-B6-Key

### IP ADDRESS
Found it running the following command in the terminal: `ping wwww.hackthis.co.uk`

### WHO IS HOSTING
I used the website https://www.whoismyisp.org/ and the IP found previously to find the ISP of the server.

### X-B6-Key
After some investigation I found that X-B6-Key may be used in Email headers.
So I went to my gmail account, found an email I had from registering in hackthis.co.uk, pressed "Show Original" button next to "Reply" and voila, X-B6-Key is right there.
