Firstly I started for searching the source code, and then I found a javascript file that had an eval function.

I run the eval function on my console, and it gave me a function called makeInviteCode();

```js
function makeInviteCode(){$.ajax({type:"POST",dataType:"json",url:'/api/invite/how/to/generate',success:function(response){console.log(response)},error:function(response){console.log(response)}})}
```

I got the following response:

{code: Va beqre gb trarengr gur vaivgr pbqr, znxr n CBFG erdhrfg gb /ncv/vaivgr/trarengr , encode: ROT-13}

After decoding, it was saying to send a POST request to /api/invite/generate

```js
let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.onload = function(e) {console.log(e)};
request.open("POST","api/invite/generate");
request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type','application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
request.send();
```

The response
```js
"success":1,"data":{"code":"Uk9aWlAtVlFDTlYtVkJERkwtQUdZTUctT1BJSVY=","format":"encoded"},"0":200}
```js

I assumed it was BASE64, and so I decoded it using a website. Profit :)
